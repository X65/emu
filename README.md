# X65 emulator

This is Emu <img src="emu.gif" alt="Emu"> The [X65 Computer][1] Emulator.

Emu is based on [chip emulators][2] by Andre Weissflog.

> The USP of the chip emulators is that they communicate with the outside world
> through a 'pin bit mask': A 'tick' function takes an uint64_t as input
> where the bits represent the chip's in/out pins, the tick function inspects
> the pin bits, computes one tick, and returns a (potentially modified) pin bit mask.
>
> A complete emulated computer then more or less just wires those chip emulators
> together just like on a breadboard.

This emulator started as a hard fork of C64 emulator example
and it shows in places - it is still a work-in-progress.
